## docker-oracle-client

A docker-container for Oracle Instant Client 12, based on CentOs. You can use this container to run any SQL script necessary against both source and target oracle databases as part of a data migration.

This container is mostly for convenience and automation of many otherwise manual SQL execution steps.
The container comes with helper scripts that are environment "aware" - that is, given a "landscape" identifier (ie: sb, ci, qa, stg, prod), connection details can be obtained dynamically using lookups through the aws cli, which is also installed.

Uses include:

- Establish a sqlplus client interactive session against any of our Kuali databases either in the "legacy" vpn accessible subnets or newer private subnets associated with the common app infrastructure account.
- Run the SQL scripts generated by the AWS schema conversion tool.
- Run post data migration validation scripts

### Use cases:

Navigate to the correct directory:

```
cd kuali-infrastructure/kuali_rds/migration/sct/docker-oracle-client
```

From here, you can run the container through a helper script.
The first time you run the container, you will see the image being built first. All subsequent calls will be more straightforward.
You can drive what the container does with name=value parameter pairs:

1. **Run interactive session:**
  
   
   Start session with "Legacy" database:
   
  ```
   # EXAMPLE 1:
   sh dbclient.sh run \ 
     aws_access_key_id=[your key] \
     aws_secret_access_key=[your secret] \
     landscape=ci \
     legacy=true \
     bucket_name=kuali-research-ec2-setup
     
   # EXAMPLE 2: A bucket name and landscape was included above because s3 contains the kc-config.xml file, which is downloaded and parsed for connection details. However, you could provide the connection details directly as follows:
   sh dbclient.sh run \
     aws_access_key_id=[your key] \
     aws_secret_access_key=[your secret] \
     legacy=true \
     db_host=buaws-kuali-db-ci001.bu.edu \
     db_port=1521 \
     db_user=KCOEUS \
     db_password=[password] \
     sid=Kuali
   ```
   
   
   Start session with"Target" RDS database:
   
   ```
   # EXAMPLE 1: 
   sh dbclient.sh run \ 
     aws_access_key_id=[your key] \
     aws_secret_access_key=[your secret] \
     landscape=ci
   
   # EXAMPLE 2: (If you know the RDS db password, you can avoid the automatic secretsmanager lookup)
   sh dbclient.sh run \ 
     aws_access_key_id=[your key] \
     aws_secret_access_key=[your secret] \
     db_password=[password] \
     landscape=ci
   
   ```
   
   
   Example output:
   
   ```
   LANDSCAPE=ci
   BUCKET_NAME=kuali-research-ec2-setup
   Using default aws profile
   {
       "RequestId": "68a23ff0-3b39-47c8-888c-9f96c6448610",
       "Success": true
   }
