## docker-oracle-client

A docker-container for Oracle Instant Client 12, based on CentOs. You can use this container to run any SQL script necessary against both source and target oracle databases as part of a data migration.

This container is mostly for convenience and automation of many otherwise manual SQL execution steps.
The container comes with helper scripts that are environment "aware" - that is, given a "landscape" identifier (ie: sb, ci, qa, stg, prod), connection details can be obtained dynamically using lookups through the aws cli, which is also installed.

Uses include:

- Establish a sqlplus client interactive session against any of our Kuali databases either in the "legacy" vpn accessible subnets or newer private subnets associated with the common app infrastructure account.
- Run the SQL scripts generated by the AWS schema conversion tool.
- Run post data migration validation scripts

### Use cases:

Navigate to the correct directory:

```
cd kuali-infrastructure/kuali_rds/migration/sct/docker-oracle-client
```

From here, you can run the container through a helper script.
The first time you run the container, you will see the image being built first. All subsequent calls will be more straightforward.
You can drive what the container does with name=value parameter pairs:

1. **Run interactive session:**
  
  Start session with "Legacy" database:
  
   ```
   # EXAMPLE 1:
   sh dbclient.sh run \ 
     aws_access_key_id=[your key] \
     aws_secret_access_key=[your secret] \
     landscape=ci \
     legacy=true \
     bucket_name=kuali-research-ec2-setup
        
   # EXAMPLE 2: A bucket name and landscape was included above because s3 contains the kc-config.xml file, which is downloaded and parsed for connection details. However, you could provide the connection details directly as follows:
   sh dbclient.sh run \
     aws_access_key_id=[your key] \
     aws_secret_access_key=[your secret] \
     legacy=true \
     db_host=buaws-kuali-db-ci001.bu.edu \
     db_port=1521 \
     db_user=KCOEUS \
     db_password=[password] \
     sid=Kuali
   ```
  
  â€‹    
  
   Start session with"Target" RDS database:
  
   ```
   # EXAMPLE 1: 
   sh dbclient.sh run \ 
     aws_access_key_id=[your key] \
     aws_secret_access_key=[your secret] \
     landscape=ci
   
   # EXAMPLE 2: (If you know the RDS db password or it's not stored in secrets manager)
   sh dbclient.sh run \ 
     aws_access_key_id=[your key] \
     aws_secret_access_key=[your secret] \
     db_password=[password] \
     landscape=ci
   ```
  
  
   Example output:
  
   ```
   LANDSCAPE=ci
   BUCKET_NAME=kuali-research-ec2-setup
   Using default aws profile
   {
       "RequestId": "68a23ff0-3b39-47c8-888c-9f96c6448610",
       "Success": true
   }

2. **Run one, multiple, or all SQL script files:**
   You can run selected SQL files against the database.
   
   - Create an `"input"` subdirectory in the same folder as dbclient.sh if it does not already exist.
      All SQL script files that you want to run should be placed in this folder.
   - The names of the files you want to run should be provided as a comma delimited list (no spaces) as a `"file_to_run"` parameter
   - The output of each file will appear in it's own log file in an `"output"` folder *(will be created on the fly if it does not already exist)*.
   
   ```
   # EXAMPLE 1: Run 3 SQL scripts against the legacy database:
   sh dbclient.sh run \
     aws_access_key_id=[your key] \
     aws_secret_access_key=[your secret] \
     landscape=ci \
     legacy=true \
     bucket_name=kuali-research-ec2-setup \
     files_to_run=test3.sql,test2.sql,test1.sql
     
   # EXAMPLE 2: Run 1 SQL script against the RDS database:
   sh dbclient.sh run \
     aws_access_key_id=[your key] \
     aws_secret_access_key=[your secret] \
     landscape=ci \
     files_to_run=test2.sql
     
   # EXAMPLE 3: Run ALL SQL script files in the input folder against the RDS database:
   sh dbclient.sh run \
     aws_access_key_id=[your key] \
     aws_secret_access_key=[your secret] \
     landscape=ci \
     files_to_run=all
   ```
   
      
   
3. **Run all SCT-generated SQL scripts:**
   The If you have generated DDL scripts with AWS Schema Conversion tool, they will exist in a different input directory:
   `../sql/[landscape]`
   These scripts will be run in the order reflected by their numeric prefix *(ie: `"03.create.kcoeus.user.sql"` will be run 3rd)*.
   Run all scripts in this folder as follows: 

   ```
   # EXAMPLE 3: Run ALL SQL script files in the input folder against the RDS database:
   sh dbclient.sh run-sct-scripts \
     aws_access_key_id=[your key] \
     aws_secret_access_key=[your secret] \
     landscape=ci
   ```

      

4. **Run Table row count comparison scripts:**
   After the AWS migration service has run, one way to validate that all data has been migrated is to compare table row counts between the source and target schemas.
   The following script will print out only the names of tables whos row counts differ between source and target schemas.
   A valid migration should lead to this script outputting no tables names.

   ```
   # EXAMPLE 3: Run ALL SQL script files in the input folder against the RDS database:
   sh dbclient.sh compare-table-counts \
     aws_access_key_id=[your key] \
     aws_secret_access_key=[your secret] \
     landscape=ci \
     bucket_name=kuali-research-ec2-setup
   ```
