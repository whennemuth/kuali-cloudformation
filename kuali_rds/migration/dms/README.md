## RDS Schema Migration

Migrate data from a source oracle kuali database schema to an empty target kuali schema of a RDS database instance. 



### Prerequisites:

- **AWS CLI:** 
  If you don't have the AWS command-line interface, you can download it here:
  [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)
- **AWS Session Manager Plugin**
  This plugin allows the AWS cli to launch Session Manager sessions with your local SSH client. The Version should be should be at least 1.1.26.0.
  Install instructions: [Install the Session Manager Plugin for the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.html)
- **IAM User/Role:**
  The cli needs to be configured with the [access key ID and secret access key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys) of an (your) IAM user. This user needs to have a role with policies sufficient to cover all of the actions to be carried out (stack creation, VPC/subnet read access, ssm sessions, secrets manager read/write access, etc.). Preferably your user will have an admin role and all policies will be covered.
- **Bash:**
  You will need the ability to run bash scripts. Natively, you can do this on a mac, though there may be some minor syntax/version differences that will prevent the scripts from working correctly. In that event, or if running windows, you can either:
  - Clone the repo on a linux box (ie: an ec2 instance), install the other prerequisites and run there.
  - Download [gitbash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- **AWS Schema Conversion Tool:**
  This is a desktop app that can be downloaded from this link: [Installing, Verifying, and Updating the AWS Schema Conversion Tool](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/SchemaConversionTool/latest/userguide/CHAP_Installing.html)
- **[SQL Developer](https://www.oracle.com/tools/technologies/whatis-sql-developer.html)** (or similar Oracle database IDE)
  This is a desktop app that can be downloaded from oracle:  [SQL Developer Download](https://www.oracle.com/tools/downloads/sqldev-downloads.html)
