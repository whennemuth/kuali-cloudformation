  # This won't work. You must manually created a resouce-based policy first.
  # Route53 is a service that, for logging, supports attaching permission policies to it as a resource, not a principal.
  # This means that route53 does not assume a role that grants it permission to log to cloudwatch, but the route53 
  # resource itself is associated with the policy that the role would have had.
