### Prerequisites:

- **AWS CLI:** 
  If you don't have the AWS command line interface, you can download it here:
  [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)
- **IAM User/Role:**
  The cli needs to be configured with the [access key ID and secret access key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys) of an (your) IAM user. This user needs to have a role with policies sufficient to cover all of the actions to be carried out (ECR access, stack creation, certificate upload, ssm sessions, etc.). Preferably your user will have an admin role and all policies will be covered.
- **Bash:**
  You will need the ability to run bash scripts. Natively, you can do this on a mac, though there may be some minor syntax/version differences that will prevent the scripts from working correctly. In that event, or if running windows, you can either:
  - Clone the repo on a linux box (ie: an ec2 instance), install the other prerequisites and run there.
  - Download [gitbash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- **Docker Images:**
  Before creating the cloudformation stack, it is assumed that each Docker image (kc, core, dashboard, pdf) has already been built and uploaded to their respective repositories in the elastic container registry of you account.
