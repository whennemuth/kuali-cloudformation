## Kuali Research Cloud Deployments on AWS

This repository provides several folders, each corresponding to the creation of a cloudformation stack and containing the associated templates and helper scripts for their use.

Once created, a stack will have created a deployment of the kuali-research application and accompanying modules within the specified aws account.

These stacks are as follows, in order of increasing scope:

- [kuali ec2](kuali_ec2/README.md)

- [kuali ec2 with alb](kuali_ec2_alb/README.md)

- [kuali ecs](kuali_ecs/README.md)

- [kuali peripherals](kuali_peripherals/README.md)
